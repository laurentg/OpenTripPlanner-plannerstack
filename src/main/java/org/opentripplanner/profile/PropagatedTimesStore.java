/**
 * Stores travel times propagated to the search targets (all vertices in the street network or a set of points of
 * interest) in one-to-many repeated raptor profile routing.
 *
 * Each raptor call finds minimum travel times to each transit stop. Those must be propagated out to the final targets,
 * giving minimum travel times to each street vertex (or each destination opportunity in accessibility analysis).
 * Those results are then merged into the summary statistics per target over the whole time window
 * (over many RAPTOR calls). This class handles the storage and merging of those summary statistics.
 *
 * Currently this includes minimum, maximum, and average earliest-arrival travel time for each target.
 * We could conceivably retain all the propagated times for every departure minute instead of collapsing them down into
 * three numbers. If they were all sorted, we could read off any quantile, including the median travel time.
 * Leaving them in departure time order would also be interesting, since you could then see visually how the travel time
 * varies as a function of departure time.
 * We could also conceivably store travel time histograms per destination, but this entails a loss of information due
 * to binning into minutes. These binned times could not be used to apply a smooth sigmoid cutoff which we usually
 * do at one-second resolution.
 *
 * When exploring single-point (one-to-many) query results it would be great to have all these stored or produced on
 * demand for visualization.
