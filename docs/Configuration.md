# Configuration

## Directory tree

Here we describe where OTP will look for its configuration files and the inputs that describe the transportation
network, as well as where it will store any temporary files or cached data. Most important is the OTP *base directory*
which defaults to `/var/otp`. Unless you tell OTP otherwise, all other configuration, input and storage directories
will be sought immediately beneath this one. This prefix follows UNIX conventions so it should work in Linux and Mac OSX
environments, but it is inappropriate under Windows or where the user running OTP either cannot obtain permissions to
`/var` or simply wishes to experiment within their home directory rather than deploy a system-wide server.
In these cases one should use the basePath switch when starting up OTP to override the default. For example:
`--basePath /home/username/otp` on a Linux system, `--basePath /Users/username/otp` in Mac OSX, or
`--basePath C:\Users\username\otp` in Windows.

OTP is configured via JSON files. The file `otp-config.json` is placed in the OTP base directory and contains settings
that affect the entire OTP instance. Each router within that instance is configured using two other JSON files placed
alongside the input files (OSM, GTFS, elevation data etc.) in the router's directory. These router-level config files
are named `build-config.json` and `router-config.json`. Each configuration option within each of these files is optional,
as are all three of the files themselves. If any option or an entire file is missing, reasonable defaults will be applied.

## Routers



## Graph build vs. router configuration

Some parts of the process that loads the street and transit network description are time consuming and memory-hungry.
To avoid repeating these slow steps every time OTP starts up, we can trigger them manually whenever the input files change,
saving the resulting transportation network description to disk. We call this prepared product a `graph` following
[mathematical terminology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28mathematics%29)), and refer to these "heavier" steps as
*graph building*. They are controlled by `build-config.json`. There are many other details of OTP operation that can be
modified without requiring the potentially long operation of rebuilding the graph. These run-time configuration options
are found in `router-config.json`.

# Graph build configuration

## Reaching a subway platform

The boarding locations for some modes of transport such as subways and airplanes can be slow to reach from the street.
When planning a trip, we need to allow additional time to reach these locations to properly inform the passenger. For
example, this helps avoid suggesting short bus rides between two subway rides as a way to improve travel time. You can
specify how long it takes to reach a subway platform

```JSON
// build-config.json
{
  subwayAccessTime: 2.5
}
```

Stops in GTFS do not necessarily serve a single transit mode, but in practice this is usually the case. This additional
access time will be added to any stop that is visited by trips on subway routes (GTFS route_type = 1).

This setting does not generalize well to airplanes because you often need much longer to check in to a flight (2-3 hours
for international flights) than to alight and exit the airport (perhaps 1 hour). Therefore there is currently no
per-mode access time, it is subway-specific.

## Transferring within stations

Subway systems tend to exist in their own layer of the city separate from the surface, though there are exceptions where
tracks lie right below the street and transfers happen via the surface. In systems where the subway is quite deep
and transfers happen via tunnels, the time required for an in-station transfer is often less than that for a
surface transfer. A proposal was made to provide detailed station pathways in GTFS but it is not in common use.

One way to resolve this problem is by ensuring that the GTFS feed codes each platform as a separate stop, then
micro-mapping stations in OSM. When OSM data contains a detailed description of walkways, stairs, and platforms within
a station, GTFS stops can be linked to the nearest platform and transfers will happen via the OSM ways, which should
yield very realistic transfer time expectations. This works particularly well in above-ground train stations where
the layering of non-intersecting ways is less prevalent. Here's an example in the Netherlands:

<iframe width="425" height="350" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://www.openstreetmap.org/export/embed.html?bbox=4.70502644777298%2C52.01675028000761%2C4.7070810198783875%2C52.01813190694357&amp;layer=mapnik" style="border: 1px solid black"></iframe><small><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/52.01744/4.70605">View Larger Map</a></small>

When such micro-mapping data is not available, we need to rely on information from GTFS including how stops are grouped
into stations and a table of transfer timings where available. During the graph build, OTP can create preferential
connections between each pair of stops in the same station to favor in-station transfers:

```JSON
// build-config.json
{
  stationTransfers: true
}
```

Note that this method is at odds with micro-mapping and might make some transfers artificially short.


## Elevation data

OpenTripPlanner can "drape" the OSM street network over a digital elevation model (DEM).
This allows OTP to draw an elevation profile for the on-street portion of itineraries, and helps provide better
routing for bicyclists. It even helps avoid hills for walking itineraries. DEMs are usually supplied as rasters
(regular grids of numbers) stored in image formats such as GeoTIFF.

### U.S. National Elevation Dataset

In the United States, a high resolution [National Elevation Dataset](http://ned.usgs.gov/) is available for the entire
territory. The US Geological Survey (USGS) delivers this dataset in tiles via a somewhat awkward heavyweight web-based GIS
which generates and emails you download links. OpenTripPlanner contains a module which will automatically contact this
service and download the proper tiles to completely cover your transit and street network area. This process is rather
slow (download is around 1.5 hours, then setting elevation for streets takes about 5 minutes for the Portland, Oregon region),
but once the tiles are downloaded OTP will keep them in local cache for the next graph build operation.

To auto-download NED tiles when building your graph, add the following line to `build-config.json` in your router
directory:

```JSON
// build-config.json
{
  fetchElevationUS: true
}
```

You may also want to add the `--cache <directory>` command line parameter to specify a custom NED tile cache location.

The USGS will also deliver the whole dataset in bulk if you [send them a hard drive](http://ned.usgs.gov/faq.html#DATA).
OpenTripPlanner contains another module that will then automatically fetch data in this format from an Amazon S3 copy of
your bulk data.

### Other raster elevation data

For other parts of the world you will need a GeoTIFF file containing the elevation data. These are often available from
national geographic surveys, or you can always fall back on the worldwide
[Space Shuttle Radar Topography Mission](http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/) (SRTM) data. This not particularly high resolution
(roughly 30 meters horizontally) but it can give acceptable results.

Simply place the elevation data file in the directory with the other graph builder inputs, alongside the GTFS and OSM data.
Make sure the file has a `.tiff` extension, and the graph builder should detect its presence and apply
the elevation data to the streets.


# Runtime router configuration

## Timeouts

Path searches can sometimes take a long time to complete, especially certain problematic cases that have yet to be optimized.
Often a first itinerary is found quickly, but it is time-consuming or impossible to find subsequent alternative itineraries
and this delays the response. You can set timeouts to avoid tying up server resources on pointless searches and ensure that
your users receive a timely response. When a search times out, a WARN level log entry is made with information that can
help identify problematic searches and improve our routing methods. The simplest timeout option is:

```JSON
// router-config.json
{
  timeout: 5.5
}
```

This specifies a single timeout in (optionally fractional) seconds. Searching is aborted after this many seconds and any
paths already found are returned to the client. This is equivalent to specifying a `timeouts` array with a single element.
The alternative is:

```JSON
// router-config.json
{
  timeouts: [5, 4, 3, 1]
}
```

Here, the configuration key is `timeouts` (plural) and we specify an array of times in floating-point seconds. The Nth
element in the array applies to the Nth itinerary search, and importantly all values are relative to the beginning of the
search for the *first* itinerary. If OTP is configured to find more itineraries than there are elements in the timeouts
array, the final element in the timeouts array will apply to all remaining unmatched searches.

This allows you to keep overall response time down while ensuring that the end user will get at least one
response, providing more only when it won't hurt response time. The timeout values will typically be decreasing to
reflect the decreasing marginal value of alternative itineraries: everyone wants at least one response, it's nice to
have two for comparison, but we only care about having three, four, or more options if completing those extra searches
doesn't cause annoyingly long response times.


## Real-time data

GTFS feeds contain *schedule* data that is is published by an agency or operator in advance. The feed does not account
 for unexpected service changes or traffic disruptions that occur from day to day. Thus, this kind of data is also
 referred to as 'static' data or 'theoretical' arrival and departure times.

### GTFS-Realtime

The [GTFS-RT spec](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/) complements GTFS with three additional kinds of
feeds. In contrast to the base GTFS schedule feed, they provide *real-time* updates (*'dynamic'* data) and are are
updated from minute to minute.

- **Alerts** are text messages attached to GTFS objects, informing riders of disruptions and changes.

- **TripUpdates** report on the status of scheduled trips as they happen, providing observed and predicted arrival and
departure times for the remainder of the trip.

- **VehiclePositions** give the location of some or all vehicles currently in service, in terms of geographic coordinates
or position relative to their scheduled stops.

### Bicycle rental systems

Besides GTFS-RT transit data, OTP can also fetch real-time data about bicycle rental networks including the number
of bikes and free parking spaces at each station. We support bike rental systems from JCDecaux, BCycle, VCub, Keolis,
Bixi, and the Dutch OVFiets system. It is straightforward to extend OTP to support any bike rental system that
exposes a JSON API or provides KML place markers, though it requires writing a little code.

### Configuration

Real-time data can be provided using either a pull or push system. In a pull configuration, the GTFS-RT consumer polls the
real-time provider over HTTP. That is to say, OTP fetches a file from a web server every few minutes. In the push
configuration, the consumer opens a persistent connection to the GTFS-RT provider, which then sends incremental updates
immediately as they become available. OTP can use both approaches.

Real-time data sources are configured in `router-config.json`. The `updaters` section is an array of JSON objects, each
of which has a `type` field and other configuration fields specific to that type. Common to all updater entries that
connect to a network resource is the `url` field.

```JSON
// router-config.json
{
    // Routing defaults are any public field or setter in the Java class
    // org.opentripplanner.routing.core.RoutingRequest
    routingDefaults: {
        numItineraries: 6,
        walkSpeed: 2.0,
        stairsReluctance: 4.0,
