# Developers Guide

## Contributing to the project

OpenTripPlanner is a community based open source project, and we welcome all who wish to contribute.
There are several ways to get involved:

 * Join the [developer mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/opentripplanner-dev)

 * Fix typos and improve the documentation on the wiki or within the `/docs` directory of the project (details below).

 * [File a bug or new feature request](http://github.com/openplans/OpenTripPlanner/issues/new).

 * Submit patches. If you're not yet a committer, please provide patches as pull requests citing the relevant issue.
   Even when you do have push access to the repository, pull requests are a good way to get feedback on changes.


### Issues and commits

All commits should reference a specific issue number (this was formally decided decided in issue #175).
For example, `Simplify module X configuration #9999`.
If no ticket exists for the feature or bug your code implements or fixes,
you should [create a new ticket](http://github.com/openplans/OpenTripPlanner/issues/new) prior to checking in, or
ideally even prior to your development work since this provides a place to carry out implementation discussions (in the comments).

Github will automatically update issues when commits are merged in: if your commit message includes the text
` fixes #123 `, it will automatically append your message as a comment on the isse and close it.
If you simply mention ` #123 ` in your message, your message will be appended to the issue but it will remain open.
Many other expressions exist to close issues via commit messages. See [the Github help page on this topic](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/).


### Code Comments

As a matter of [policy](http://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/issues/93), all new methods, classes, and 
fields should include comments explaining what they are for and any other pertinent information. For Java code, 
the comments should use the [JavaDoc conventions](http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments).
It is best to provide comments that
not only explain *what* you did but also *why you did it* while providing some context. Please avoid including trivial
Javadoc or the empty Javadoc stubs added by IDEs, such as `@param` annotations with no description.

### Documentation

Most documentation should be included directly in the OpenTripPlanner repository rather than the Github wiki.
This allows version control to be applied to documentation as well as program source code.
All pull requests that change how OTP is used or configured should include changes to the documentation alongside code
modifications. Pages that help organize development teams or serve as scratchpads can still go
[on the wiki](https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/wiki), but all documentation that would be of interest
to people configuring or using OTP belong [in the repo](https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/tree/master/docs).

The documentation files are in Markdown format and are in the `/docs` directory under the root of the project. On every
push to the master branch the documentation will be rebuilt and deployed as static pages to our subdomain of
[ReadTheDocs](http://opentripplanner.readthedocs.org/). MkDocs is a Python program and should run on any major platform.
See http://www.mkdocs.org/ for information on how to install it and how to generate a live local preview of the
documentation while you're working on writing it.

In short:

```
$ pip install mkdocs
$ mkdocs serve
```


### Date format

Please use only ISO 8601 date format (YYYY-MM-DD) in documentation, comments, and throughout the project.
This avoids the ambiguity that can result from differing local interpretations of date formats like 02/01/12.


### Project proposals and decision making

Decisions are made by the OpenTripPlanner community through a proposal and informal voting process on the 
[project mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/opentripplanner-dev).

While we do vote on proposals, we don't vote in a strict democratic sense, but rather as a way to easily register 
opinions, foster discussion, and move toward consensus. When responding to a proposal, we use the following system:

 * +1 - *I support this*

 * +0 - *I don't have a strong opinion, but I'm not opposed*

 * -0 - *I'm against this, but I don't have a good alternative / I'm not willing to do the work on the alternative / I won't block*

 * -1 - *Blocking no* (note: in general and when appropriate, this requires the blocker to propose something else that he/she would help put the time into doing)

A proposal does *not* need to be a formal or lengthy document; it can and should be a straightforward recommendation of 
what you want to do, ideally with a brief explanation for why it's a good idea. 

Proposals are just messages sent to the list and can be as simple as *"I think we should do X because of Y and Z. 
Deadline for response is 2015-10-29. Assuming I've heard no blocking votes by then, I'll go ahead."*
Note that you should make sure to include a **deadline** by which you will go ahead and do what you're proposing 
if you don't hear any blocking responses. In general, you should leave at least 72 hours for people to respond. 
This is not a hard-and-fast rule and you should use your best judgement in determining how far in the future the 
deadline should be depending on the magnitude of the proposal and how much it will effect the overall project and the 
rest of the community.

Of course you may always fork the [OTP repo on GitHub](https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/) 
and submit your changes as a pull request, or develop and share whatever features you like on your fork even if they
are not included in mainline OTP.


## Code style

### Java

OpenTripPlanner uses the same code formatting and style as the [GeoTools](http://www.geotools.org/) and 
[GeoServer](htp://geoserver.org) projects. It's a minor variant of the 
[Sun coding convention](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconv-138413.html). Notably, **we do not use tabs** 
for indentation and we allow for lines up to 100 characters wide.

The Eclipse formatter configuration supplied by the GeoTools project allows comments up to 150 characters wide.
A modified version included in the OpenTripPlanner repository will wrap comments to the same width as lines of code, 
which makes for easier reading in narrow windows (e.g. when several documents are open side-by-side on a wide display).

If you use Eclipse, you should do the following to make sure your code is automatically formatted correctly:

1. Open the project `Properties` (right-click on the project directory in Eclipse and select `Properties` or choose `Project` -> `Properties`).

2. Select `Java`, then `Code Style`, and finally `Formatter`.  

3. Check the `Enable project specific settings` checkbox.

4. Click `Import...`, select the `formatter.xml` file in the root of the OpenTripPlanner git repository, and click `Open`.

5. Click `OK` to close the `Properties` window.


### JavaScript

As of #206, we follow [Crockford's JavaScript code conventions](http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html). Further guidelines include:

 * All .js source files should contain one class only

 * Capitalize the class name, as well as the source file name (a la Java)

 * Include the GNU LGPL header at top of file, i.e., `/* This program is free software:...*/`

 * Include the namespace definition in each and every file: `otp.namespace("otp.configure");`

 * Include a class comment. For example,                                                                                                      

```java
    /**
     * Configure Class
     *
     * Purpose is to allow a generic configuration object to be read via AJAX/JSON, and inserted into an Ext Store
     * The implementation is TriMet route map specific...but replacing ConfigureStore object (or member variables) with
     * another implementation, will give this widget flexibility for other uses beyond the iMap.
     *
     * @class
     */
```

*Note: There is still a lot of code following other style conventions. We are reformatting as we write new code and refactor.*
